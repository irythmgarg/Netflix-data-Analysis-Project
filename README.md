# Netflix-data-Analysis-Project

In this project, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a movie dataset to extract insights and visualize trends. The dataset included various attributes like movie titles, genres, popularity scores, vote averages, release dates, and more.
Key steps involved:
Loaded and cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates and unnecessary columns.

Converted date fields to proper datetime format and extracted the release year.

Categorized numerical columns like Vote_Average into meaningful labels.

Split and exploded multi-genre entries to analyze individual genres.

Visualized the distribution of popularity and vote averages using histograms and count plots.

Plotted a bar graph showing the number of movies released each year.

This project helps in understanding patterns in movie data, such as trends in movie production, genre frequency, and viewer ratings.
